# Decentralized-Patient-Record-Storage-Smart Contract/Solidity/Truffle/Ganache Network/Ethereum
Decentralized Patient Record  Storage using Solidity in Ethereum Blockchain

Skills used in the project and their usage in the industry are given below: 
  •	Solidity – It is an object-oriented programming language that can be used to create smart contracts on a variety of blockchain systems. 
  •	VS Code – Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control.
  •	Ganache Blockchain - It is a tool for creating a private Ethereum blockchain on which Solidity contracts can be tested.
  •	Truffle - Truffle is a world-class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)



The patient record is one of the important assets that is currently centralized, maintained, and managed by hospitals. 
Some countries have moved to Electronic Health Record (EHR), and many countries still follow the old method to store the patient and medical details. Around 80 to 90% of the hospitals in the United States have adopted basic EHR systems, which have a lot of problems related to privacy, security, and ownership of these health records. 
Even after moving to EHR, the patient record is completely owned and controlled by hospitals, and being the owner of that record, a patient does not have access to the data and has to always reach out to hospitals to get it.
Data consolidation is one of the biggest challenges as every hospital stores these EHRs on their server. The patients need to access different EHRs to consolidate their complete medical history.
Since hospitals own the EHRs, they have full control and can manipulate the data at any moment. They can even sell the data to research organization and earn a good amount of money.
Along with the patient record, doctor authenticity is another challenge that is faced as there is no direct way to check if the doctor is real or not. 

Roles:

In this solution, we are going to focus on two roles:
  ●	Patient
  ●	Doctor

A patient can do the following functions:
  ●	Register to the portal
  ●	Add new diseases 
  ●	View their records
  ●	Update their data

A doctor can do the following things:
  ●	Register to the portal
  ●	Access and add the records of their patients
  ●	Prescribe medicine to a patient
